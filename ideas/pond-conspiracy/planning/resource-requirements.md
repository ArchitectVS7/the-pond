## Hiring and Training

### Skill Gaps (Current Team: TBD)

**Assuming baseline team of 1 programmer + 1 artist**:

**Existing Skills** (likely):
- GDScript: ✅ (programmer has)
- Godot Engine: ✅ (programmer has)
- Pixel Art: ✅ (artist has)

**Skill Gaps** (need to acquire):
- **Steam API integration**: Train programmer (1 week, GodotSteam docs)
- **Shader programming**: Train programmer (2 weeks, colorblind shaders)
- **Technical writing**: Hire contractor (Week 4-6)
- **Audio engineering**: Hire contractor (Month 3)
- **UI/UX design**: Hire contractor (Week 0-2)

---

### Training Recommendations

1. **GodotSteam Plugin** (Programmer, Week 0)
   - Read official docs: https://godotsteam.com
   - Set up Steam partner account
   - Test achievements, cloud saves on test app
   - **Time**: 1 week

2. **Shader Programming (Colorblind Modes)** (Programmer, Week 10)
   - Learn Godot shader language (GLSL-like)
   - Study colorblind filter matrices
   - Test with online colorblind simulators
   - **Time**: 1 week

3. **BulletUpHell Plugin** (Programmer, Day 1)
   - Fork repository, read source code
   - Understand bullet pattern API
   - Test performance with 500+ bullets
   - **Time**: 3 days

## Resource Risks

### 1. Single Point of Failure (Programmer)
**Risk**: Programmer is sole expert in GDScript, Godot, Steam API
**Impact**: HIGH - Project stops if programmer unavailable
**Probability**: Medium (20%)
**Mitigation**:
- Document all architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Write code comments, keep README updated
- Use version control (Git), commit frequently
- Consider training Product Manager as backup (basic GDScript)

---

### 2. Pixel Art Scope Creep
**Risk**: Pixel art takes longer than estimated (boss sprites, conspiracy board assets)
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Delays milestones if art not ready
**Probability**: Medium (30%)
**Mitigation**:
- Lock art style early (pixel size, palette)
- Use placeholder art for prototyping
- Consider contracting 2nd pixel artist if behind schedule

---

### 3. NGO Partnership Delays
**Risk**: NGO content review takes >2 weeks
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Delays M2 if data logs not approved
**Probability**: Low-Medium (20%)
**Mitigation**:
- Start NGO outreach Week 0 (before coding begins)
- Build 2-week buffer into M2 timeline
- Have backup NGO contacts (Waterkeeper Alliance, Sierra Club, etc.)

---

### 4. Accessibility Expertise Gap
**Risk**: Team lacks WCAG AA compliance expertise
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Accessibility features may not meet standard
**Probability**: Medium (30%)
**Mitigation**:
- Use automated WCAG checker (axe DevTools)
- Test with real screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
- Hire accessibility consultant for 1-week audit (Week 11)

---

### 5. Audio Engineering Gap
**Risk**: No in-house audio engineer for dynamic music system
**Impact**: LOW - Alpha feature, can defer if needed
**Probability**: Low (10%)
**Mitigation**:
- Hire audio contractor Month 3 (pre-vetted)
- Have simple fallback: static music tracks (no dynamic crossfade)
- Alpha feature = can defer to Beta if necessary

## Key Takeaways

1. **Core Team**: 1 programmer + 1 pixel artist + 0.5 PM is sufficient for MVP
2. **Contractors**: Need UI/UX designer (Week 0-2), technical writer (Week 4-6), audio engineer (Month 3)
3. **Skill Gaps**: Train programmer on Steam API, shaders; hire contractors for specialized skills
4. **Risks**: Single point of failure (programmer), NGO delays, pixel art scope creep
5. **Budget**: ~$5-8K contractors (UI designer $1.5K, writer $2K, audio $2K, QA $1.5K, accessibility audit $1K)
