## The Human Moment

Launch day is exciting and terrifying. Some things to remember:

- **Sleep the night before**. You'll need it.
- **Eat actual food**. Not just snacks at your desk.
- **Have support**. Friends, family, co-devs who understand.
- **Celebrate the milestone**. Regardless of numbers, you shipped.
- **Take breaks**. You can't fix bugs if you're exhausted.

This is the culmination of months of work. The pond has been filled, the frog is ready, and the conspiracy is waiting to be uncovered.

Good luck.
