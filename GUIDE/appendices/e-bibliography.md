## Satire vs. Reality

The Pond uses satire to engage players with environmental issues. Key distinctions:

| Game Element | Real Basis | Satirical Exaggeration |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Pollution mutations | Real endocrine disruption | Visible combat abilities |
| Corporate bosses | Documented corporate negligence | Bullet-hell attacks |
| 70% compliance gap | EPA enforcement statistics | Round number for impact |
| Instant effects | Long-term bioaccumulation | Immediate visual feedback |

The humor comes from absurdity, but the underlying problems are real.
