# NGO Outreach

The Pond has an environmental message. A partnership with a real environmental organization gives that message credibility and creates mutual benefit: they get exposure to gamers, you get authenticity and potential promotional support.

This is relationship-building. It takes weeks to months. Start early.

---

## Why This Matters

Without NGO involvement, The Pond is just another game with environmental theming. With it, you have:

- **Credibility**: Real scientists/activists reviewed your content
- **Accuracy**: Your pollution facts are verified
- **Marketing**: Potential social media cross-promotion
- **Impact**: Actual donations or awareness tied to game sales
- **Press angle**: "Game partners with [org] to fight pollution" is a story

## Blocked Stories

These planning stories are marked "BLOCKED - human required":

| Story ID | Description | Why Blocked |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| DATA-005 | NGO partnership outreach | Requires human contact |
| DATA-006 | NGO content review approval | Depends on DATA-005 |

The code is ready. The templates exist. What's missing is you sending emails and having conversations.

---

## Target Organizations

Focus on organizations that match your game's theme: water pollution, corporate accountability, and environmental protection.

### Tier 1: Direct Match

| Organization | Focus | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Waterkeeper Alliance | Water quality protection | Direct match to "polluted pond" theme |
| River Network | River conservation | Overlaps with water ecosystem focus |
| Ocean Conservancy | Marine/water protection | Broader scope but relevant |

### Tier 2: Environmental Advocacy

| Organization | Focus | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Sierra Club | General environmental | Large reach, activist-oriented |
| EDF (Environmental Defense Fund) | Corporate accountability | Matches "conspiracy" theme |
| Greenpeace | Direct action | Controversial but high-profile |

### Tier 3: Gaming + Environment

| Organization | Focus | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Playing for the Planet | Gaming industry sustainability | Might feature your game |
| Green Game Jam | Environmental games | Potential event participation |

**Start with Tier 1**. More targeted = more relevant = higher response rate.

## The Outreach Template

A template exists at `conspiracy_board/content/outreach_template.md`. Here's the structure:

### Subject Line

```
Indie Game Partnership: Environmental Education Through Interactive Storytelling
```

Direct, professional, hints at mutual benefit.

### Email Body

```
Hello [Name/Team],

I'm developing The Pond, an indie game where players uncover corporate
pollution conspiracies. The game uses real environmental data to tell
a story about water pollution and ecosystem destruction.

I'm reaching out because [specific reason related to their work].

What I'm proposing:
- Your organization reviews the game's environmental content for accuracy
- We include a mention/link to your organization in the game's credits
- [Optional] A percentage of sales goes to your organization
- [Optional] Cross-promotion on game launch

The game is currently in [development stage] with a planned release on
Steam in [timeframe].

I'd love to send you a build or discuss how we might work together.

Best,
[Your name]
[Your website/social]
```

### Personalization Is Critical

**Don't send the template as-is.** For each organization:

1. Find a specific person (not generic contact@)
2. Reference their recent work ("I saw your report on [X]...")
3. Explain why *their* organization specifically
4. Mention any overlap with your game's specific content

### Finding Contacts

- Organization websites often have "Media" or "Press" contacts
- LinkedIn for specific people (Communications Manager, Outreach Director)
- Twitter/X for informal initial contact
- Look for game industry crossover (have they partnered with games before?)

---

## What to Offer

You're asking for their time. Offer something in return:

### Low Commitment (Start Here)
- Credit in game
- Link to their organization
- "Approved by [org]" badge (if they agree)

### Medium Commitment
- Fixed donation per sale ($0.50-$1.00)
- Featured placement in conspiracy board content
- Social media cross-promotion

### High Commitment (Probably Too Much)
- Co-branded marketing
- Their logo on store page
- Significant percentage of revenue

**Start low**. You can always offer more. Starting high makes you look like you haven't done this before.

---

## Timeline Expectations

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| Initial outreach | Day 1 |
| First response | 1-4 weeks |
| Follow-up if no response | Week 2-3 |
| Discussion/negotiation | Weeks 2-6 |
| Content review | Weeks 4-8 |
| Agreement finalized | Weeks 6-12 |

**Be patient**. NGOs are busy. They get many requests. Yours isn't urgent to them.

### Follow-Up Strategy

- **Week 2**: If no response, send polite follow-up
- **Week 4**: Try different contact method (if emailed, try Twitter)
- **Week 6**: If still nothing, move to next organization on list
- **Don't spam**: 2-3 follow-ups maximum

---

## Content Review Process

If an NGO agrees to review your content:

### What to Send

1. **Game build** (playable demo or full game)
2. **All environmental content extracted**:
   - Data log text (`conspiracy_board/content/data_logs/`)
   - Dialogue mentioning pollution
   - In-game statistics and claims
3. **Source citations** for any claimed facts
4. **Specific questions** you want answered

### What to Expect

- They'll flag factual errors
- They may suggest different framing
- They might request more nuance
- Turnaround: 1-4 weeks depending on their bandwidth

### Handling Feedback

**Do**:
- Thank them promptly
- Implement reasonable changes
- Ask clarifying questions

**Don't**:
- Argue about their expertise
- Ignore feedback then claim approval
- Rush them

---

## Legal Considerations

### Permission to Use Name

If using their organization name or logo:
- Get written permission
- Clarify exactly how you'll use it
- Keep email/document trail

### Donation Claims

If promising donations:
- Be specific about amount
- Document the agreement
- Actually donate (obviously)
- Consider setting up through their platform if they have one

### Review ≠ Endorsement

Clarify what "review" means:
- "Reviewed for accuracy" is safe
- "Endorsed by" requires explicit approval
- "In partnership with" needs formal agreement

---

## Tracking Outreach

| Organization | Contact | Date Sent | Response | Status |
|--------------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Waterkeeper Alliance | | | | Not Started |
| River Network | | | | Not Started |
| Ocean Conservancy | | | | Not Started |
| Sierra Club | | | | Not Started |
| EDF | | | | Not Started |

Update this as you go.

## If No One Responds

It happens. Alternatives:

### Self-Cite Sources
- Use publicly available data (EPA, UN Environment, scientific papers)
- Cite sources in-game
- No partnership needed for factual information

### Smaller Organizations
- Local watershed groups
- University environmental programs
- Environmental journalism outlets

### No Partnership, Just Accuracy
- Hire a consultant to review content
- Pay a graduate student in environmental science
- Less marketing value, but still ensures accuracy

## Sample Personalized Email

Here's what a real outreach email might look like:

```
Subject: Indie Game Featuring Water Pollution Themes - Partnership Inquiry

Hi Sarah,

I saw Waterkeeper Alliance's recent report on microplastic contamination
in the Hudson River, and it directly relates to a game I'm developing.

The Pond is an indie roguelike where players uncover a conspiracy of
corporate pollution. The game uses real pollution data - including
microplastics, industrial runoff, and ecosystem collapse - as the
foundation for its story.

I'm reaching out because your "Swimmable, Drinkable, Fishable" campaign
aligns perfectly with what the game is trying to communicate to a
younger, gaming-savvy audience.

I'd love for Waterkeeper Alliance to review the game's environmental
content for accuracy. In exchange, we'd feature a prominent credit and
link to your organization, and I'm open to discussing donation
arrangements.

The game is currently in alpha with a planned Steam release in [Q# 20XX].

Would you or someone on your team have 15 minutes for a call or email
exchange to explore this?

Best,
[Your name]
[Your portfolio/website]
[Link to game trailer or demo, if available]
```
