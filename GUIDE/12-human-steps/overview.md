# Human Steps

The code is written. The systems work. What remains is the work that AI can't do for you.

This chapter is your checklist for everything that requires human hands, human judgment, or human relationships. Each section is a step-by-step guide, written to be actionable right now.

## What's Here

| Guide | What You'll Do | Time Estimate |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| [Art Asset Checklist](art-asset-checklist.md) | Commission or create ~15 art assets | Days to weeks |
| [Audio Asset Checklist](audio-asset-checklist.md) | Source or create SFX and music | Days to weeks |
| [Steam Store Setup](steam-store-setup.md) | Register, configure, and submit to Steam | 2-4 hours + review time |
| [Hardware Testing](hardware-testing.md) | Validate on GTX 1060, Steam Deck, Linux | 2-4 hours per platform |
| [NGO Outreach](ngo-outreach.md) | Contact environmental organizations | Weeks to months |
| [Accessibility Validation](accessibility-validation.md) | Test with real assistive technology users | Days |

## Priority Order

If you're wondering where to start:

### 1. Steam Store Setup (Do First)
You need a Steam App ID before you can properly test Steam features. The $100 fee and app creation takes minutes. Review can take days. Start now.

### 2. Art Assets (Start Early)
Art takes time. Whether you're learning pixel art, commissioning an artist, or using AI generation with cleanup, start this process early. The game needs:
- Player frog sprite (animated)
- 3 enemy types
- 4 boss sprites
- UI elements
- 15 mutation icons

### 3. Audio Assets (Parallel with Art)
Similar timeline to art. You need:
- Hit/death sound effects
- UI sounds
- 3+ music tracks
- Boss music

### 4. Hardware Testing (After Steam Setup)
Once you have a Steam build:
- Test on GTX 1060 equivalent (or lower)
- Test on Steam Deck (if available)
- Test on Linux

### 5. NGO Outreach (Ongoing)
This is relationship-building. Send initial outreach early, expect responses over weeks. The template is ready - you just need to send it.

### 6. Accessibility Validation (Before Launch)
Find real users of assistive technology. Screen reader testing, colorblind testing, keyboard-only testing. This happens after the other pieces are in place.

## Blocked Stories

These stories from the planning phase are marked "BLOCKED - human required":

| Story ID | Description | Guide |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| BOARD-001 | Figma prototype creation | Design tool access required |
| BOARD-002 | Recruit 10 testers | [NGO Outreach](ngo-outreach.md) |
| BOARD-003 | Achieve 8/10 satisfaction | Depends on testing |
| DATA-005 | NGO partnership outreach | [NGO Outreach](ngo-outreach.md) |
| DATA-006 | NGO content review approval | Depends on DATA-005 |

These aren't failures - they're intentional. Some things require human judgment, relationships, and iteration that can't be scripted.

## Next Steps

Pick one and start:

1. **[Steam Store Setup](steam-store-setup.md)** - If you haven't registered yet
2. **[Art Asset Checklist](art-asset-checklist.md)** - If you're ready to commission or create
3. **[NGO Outreach](ngo-outreach.md)** - If you want to start building relationships

The code will wait. These human steps take time. Start now.
