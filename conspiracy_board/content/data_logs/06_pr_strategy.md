**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS GROUP**
**Crisis Management & Reputation Services**

**TO:** Richard Daniels, VP Operations - Riverside Industrial
**FROM:** Melissa Hartwell, Senior Partner - SCG
**DATE:** September 18, 2024
**RE:** Reputation Management Proposal - Wetland Contamination Allegations
**PROJECT CODE:** RI-2024-ENV-CRISIS

---

### Situation Analysis

**Background:**
Recent media coverage regarding alleged pollution of [REDACTED] wetland has created reputational risk for Riverside Industrial. A viral social media post (47K shares) featuring photos of dead fish and deformed frogs has been attributed to your facility's discharge practices.

Local environmental groups (Green River Alliance, Citizens for Clean Water) are organizing protests and demanding EPA investigation. Mainstream media outlets (Tribune, State Environmental Watch) have begun inquiries.

**Threat Level:** MODERATE (escalating to HIGH if unaddressed)

**Recommendation:** Proactive narrative control through strategic communications campaign.

---

### Objectives

1. **Shift Public Perception:** Reposition Riverside Industrial as environmental steward, not polluter
2. **Neutralize Opposition:** Discredit activist groups as "extremists" with anti-business agenda
3. **Control Media Narrative:** Dominate search results with positive content, bury negative stories
4. **Prevent Regulatory Action:** Demonstrate "voluntary commitment" to reduce EPA scrutiny

**Success Metric:** 70% positive or neutral sentiment in social media monitoring within 90 days

---

### Tactical Plan

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Response (Week 1-2)**

**Tactic 1.1: "Corrective Measures" Announcement**
Issue press release announcing that Riverside has "voluntarily conducted internal review" and is "implementing additional safeguards" (details intentionally vague).

**Key Messaging:**
- "We take environmental stewardship seriously"
- "Out of an abundance of caution, we are enhancing monitoring protocols"
- "Preliminary findings show no evidence of permit violations"

**Tactic 1.2: Third-Party Validation**
Retain environmental consulting firm (recommendation: ECO-Consult Partners—they have a strong track record of favorable findings) to conduct limited-scope assessment. Publicize results showing "compliance with applicable standards."

**Budget:** $85,000 (consulting fee includes favorable report)

---

#### **Phase 2: Positive Narrative Building (Week 3-8)**

**Tactic 2.1: "Green Initiative" Launch**
Announce partnership with local schools to create "Wetland Education Program." Provide $25,000 grant for nature trail improvements and educational signage.

**Media Angle:**
- Photo ops: CEO with elementary students planting native grasses
- Press release: "Riverside invests in wetland conservation"
- Social media: #RiversideCares, #WetlandEducation

**Note:** This initiative does NOT involve actual pollution remediation. It's strictly optics.

**Budget:** $25,000 (grant) + $15,000 (PR event production)

**Tactic 2.2: Sponsored Content**
Place advertorial articles in local newspapers emphasizing Riverside's "commitment to sustainability" and "decades of community partnership."

**Outlets:**
- River County Gazette (circulation: 18K)
- Business Digest (circulation: 12K)
- Community Happenings (free weekly)

**Budget:** $40,000 (content production + placement fees)

**Tactic 2.3: Influencer Engagement**
Recruit local micro-influencers (5K-20K followers) to tour the facility and post positive content. Provide talking points, B-roll footage, and "collaboration fees."

**Target influencers:**
- Local business bloggers
- Outdoors/fishing enthusiasts (who fish elsewhere, not in contaminated waters)
- "Pro-jobs" community advocates

**Budget:** $30,000 (influencer fees + event hosting)

---

#### **Phase 3: Opposition Neutralization (Week 4-12)**

**Tactic 3.1: Discredit Environmental Groups**
Commission opposition research on Green River Alliance and Citizens for Clean Water. Identify:
- Funding sources (especially out-of-state donors)
- Any past controversial statements by leadership
- Legal or financial irregularities

Leak findings to sympathetic reporters as "grassroots groups funded by radical environmentalists."

**Budget:** $50,000 (research firm retainer)

**Tactic 3.2: Astroturfing Campaign**
Create fake grassroots group: "River County Jobs Coalition" (domain pre-registered: www.rivercountyjobs.org).

**Messaging:**
- "Environmental extremists want to destroy local jobs"
- "Riverside Industrial employs 200 families"
- "Activists care more about frogs than people"

**Tactics:**
- Facebook ads targeting River County residents (age 35-65)
- Letter-to-editor submissions (appear to be from "concerned citizens")
- Robocall campaign to local households

**Budget:** $120,000 (ad spend, web development, call center)

**Tactic 3.3: Legal Intimidation**
Send cease-and-desist letters to activists making "defamatory claims" about pollution. SLAPP lawsuit threat will chill speech without requiring actual litigation.

**Budget:** $15,000 (legal fees)

---

#### **Phase 4: SEO and Digital Dominance (Ongoing)**

**Tactic 4.1: Search Engine Optimization**
Bury negative search results by flooding Google with positive content:
- Create 20+ blog posts about Riverside's "environmental leadership"
- Optimize for keywords: "Riverside Industrial environmental," "wetland pollution River County"
- Backlink network via partner sites and "news" blogs

**Goal:** Push negative articles to page 3+ of search results (95% of users never go past page 2)

**Budget:** $75,000 (SEO agency retainer, 6 months)

**Tactic 4.2: Social Media Monitoring & Response**
Deploy social listening tools to track mentions of "Riverside Industrial" and "wetland pollution." Respond to negative posts with:
- Friendly, non-defensive corrections
- Links to "fact-based" resources (i.e., our sponsored content)
- Report egregious posts as "misinformation" to platforms

**Budget:** $40,000 (monitoring software + response team)

### Budget Summary

| Phase | Tactics | Cost |
|-------|---------|------|
| Phase 1 | Immediate Response | $85,000 |
| Phase 2 | Positive Narrative | $110,000 |
| Phase 3 | Opposition Neutralization | $185,000 |
| Phase 4 | Digital Dominance | $115,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **Campaign Investment** | **$495,000** |

**Additional Retainer:** SCG monthly crisis management retainer: $60,000/month (recommended 12-month contract = $720,000)

**GRAND TOTAL: $1,215,000**

---

### Risk Mitigation

**What if real evidence of pollution emerges?**
Double down on "we're addressing it voluntarily" narrative. Emphasize that contamination predates current management. Shift blame to legacy operations or "natural background levels."

**What if EPA files enforcement action?**
Pivot to "overzealous regulation" frame. Claim EPA is harassing job creators. Mobilize Jobs Coalition to pressure local politicians to intervene.

**What if whistleblower comes forward?**
Discredit as "disgruntled former employee" with "axe to grind." Threaten defamation lawsuit. Leak selective personnel records showing performance issues.

---

### Next Steps

If you approve this proposal, SCG can begin Phase 1 execution within 72 hours. We have pre-drafted press releases and have already secured availability with ECO-Consult Partners.

This is a proven playbook. We've successfully deployed similar campaigns for clients in chemical manufacturing, oil & gas, and industrial agriculture. In 80% of cases, negative media coverage drops to negligible levels within 6 months.

**The key is acting before the narrative hardens.**

Please confirm approval and wire initial retainer ($250K) to begin work.

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

You found this proposal in an email attachment carelessly left open on a computer at the community library. Someone from Riverside was using the public terminal—probably thought no one would notice.

They thought wrong.

$1.2 million to spin a lie.
$0 to clean up the poison.

You screenshot the entire document before the session times out.

The "Wetland Education Program" launched last week. The CEO was on TV, surrounded by smiling children, talking about "investing in our natural heritage."

Now you know what that investment really bought: silence.
