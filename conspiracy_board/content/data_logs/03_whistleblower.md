# Data Log 03: Whistleblower Testimony - Night Shift Dumping

## TL;DR
Former plant supervisor testifies under oath about years of illegal night-time waste dumping into wetlands. Management ordered employees to falsify logs, intimidated dissenters, and routed toxic sludge directly into protected waterways. Supervisor faced retaliation and unemployment after reporting violations.

### Statement Under Oath

My name is James Rodriguez. I worked for Riverside Industrial for five years before being terminated in September 2024. I am providing this testimony voluntarily in hopes that the truth about illegal dumping practices will finally be exposed.

**Background:**
I was hired in May 2019 as a wastewater treatment operator. By 2021, I was promoted to night shift supervisor, overseeing a crew of six employees responsible for managing industrial discharge from the chemical processing plant.

**Standard Operating Procedure (Official):**
According to our training manuals and EPA permit, all wastewater was supposed to pass through a multi-stage treatment system:
1. pH neutralization
2. Heavy metal precipitation
3. Biological treatment (activated sludge)
4. Final clarification and discharge to municipal sewer

This process takes 18-24 hours and costs approximately $12,000 per week in chemicals and electricity.

**Actual Practice (Undocumented):**
In June 2021, my supervisor, Dale Hutchins (Plant Operations Manager), pulled me aside after a shift. He told me that corporate had implemented a "cost optimization strategy" to improve margins. Starting the following Monday, we were instructed to bypass the treatment system entirely during night shifts (10 PM - 6 AM).

The new protocol was simple: open valve #7 on the eastern discharge line, which routed untreated sludge directly into the drainage culvert leading to the wetland preserve. We were told to log this discharge as "stormwater runoff" in our compliance records.

**What We Were Dumping:**
The untreated waste contained:
- Heavy metals (chromium, lead, cadmium) from metal plating operations
- Organic solvents (trichloroethylene, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone)
- Acidic rinse water (pH 2-3) from pickling baths
- Process cooling water laced with anti-corrosion chemicals

I personally witnessed this discharge turn the culvert water a milky gray color. By morning, the discoloration would dissipate downstream into the wetland, leaving no visible trace.

**Volume and Frequency:**
We dumped approximately 15,000 gallons per night, five nights per week. Over three years, I estimate we illegally discharged more than 10 million gallons of untreated industrial waste into protected wetlands.

**Intimidation and Retaliation:**
In March 2023, one of my crew members, Luis Herrera, refused to participate. He said his family fished in the river downstream and he wasn't going to "poison his own kids."

Two weeks later, Luis was fired for "repeated safety violations." His personnel file was retroactively filled with write-ups dated months earlier. HR told him he was ineligible for unemployment because he was terminated "for cause."

After Luis was gone, Dale called a meeting. He told us that anyone who "couldn't handle the heat" was welcome to leave, but that Riverside had "very good lawyers" and that whistleblowers often found themselves "unhireable in this industry."

I kept my mouth shut. I needed the job. I have two kids in college.

**The Breaking Point:**
In August 2024, I noticed dead fish floating in the culvert. A lot of them. I also saw deformed frogs—missing legs, extra limbs, cloudy eyes. It looked like something out of a horror movie.

I took photos on my phone and sent them to the Illinois EPA hotline. Two days later, I was called into HR and accused of "stealing company property" (my work phone, which I'd been using for years). I was fired on the spot, escorted out by security, and told that if I spoke to the media, I'd be sued for violating my NDA.

I'm done being silent.

**What I'm Asking For:**
I don't want money. I want accountability. I want the EPA to inspect that culvert, test the soil, and hold Riverside responsible. I want my former coworkers to know they don't have to choose between their paycheck and their conscience.

And I want whoever made the decision to bypass the treatment system—whether it was Dale, or someone higher up—to face consequences.

**Supporting Evidence:**
I have retained:
- Personal photos of discolored discharge (Aug 2024)
- Copies of falsified logbooks showing discrepancies in chemical usage
- Text messages from Dale Hutchins with coded language about "efficiency protocols"
- Employment records documenting my termination

I am willing to testify in court if necessary.

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

You found this affidavit printed and stapled, hidden inside a waterproof plastic bag weighted down with a rock. It was submerged near the old drainage pipe—the one that smells like chemicals when the water is low.

Someone wanted this testimony preserved. Someone wanted it found.

James Rodriguez risked everything to tell this story.

Now it's your turn to make sure it wasn't for nothing.
