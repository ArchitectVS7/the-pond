# Data Log 05: Internal Safety Report - Ignored Warnings

## TL;DR
Internal safety audit from April 2024 warned management about deteriorating wastewater infrastructure and imminent risk of catastrophic chemical spill into wetlands. Recommended immediate repairs ($850K). Management response: defer repairs indefinitely, suppress report, threaten employees who raised concerns.

**INTERNAL SAFETY AUDIT REPORT**
**Audit No.:** 2024-EHS-0412
**Audit Date:** April 8-12, 2024
**Facility:** River Valley Chemical Processing Plant
**Lead Auditor:** Patricia Nguyen, CIH, CSP
**Report Status:** CONFIDENTIAL - MANAGEMENT REVIEW ONLY

---

### Executive Summary

This audit was conducted in response to employee safety concerns regarding aging wastewater infrastructure at the River Valley facility. Our findings indicate **immediate and substantial risk** to both worker safety and environmental compliance.

**Overall Risk Rating:** CRITICAL
**Recommended Actions:** URGENT - See Section 4

---

### Section 1: Infrastructure Assessment

#### Primary Wastewater Holding Tank (Tank 7-B)
**Installation Date:** 1987 (37 years old)
**Design Lifespan:** 25 years
**Current Condition:** SEVERELY DEGRADED

**Findings:**
- Extensive corrosion detected on interior walls (visual inspection via access port)
- Wall thickness measurements show 40% loss of material in lower sections
- Three active leak points identified, currently sealed with epoxy patches (temporary solution)
- Cathodic protection system non-functional since 2019 (anode bed depleted)

**Risk Assessment:**
Tank 7-B currently holds 85,000 gallons of acidic wastewater containing heavy metals and organic solvents. Structural failure would result in uncontrolled release into soil and groundwater. Wetland is located 300 meters downgradient.

**Probability of Failure:** HIGH (within 12-18 months)
**Consequence of Failure:** CATASTROPHIC (environmental, legal, reputational)

---

#### Secondary Containment System
**Design Requirement:** 110% of primary tank volume
**Actual Capacity:** 60% (due to silt accumulation and crack damage)

**Findings:**
- Concrete containment berm has multiple cracks >3mm width
- Drainage sump pump non-operational (motor burned out, not replaced)
- 18 inches of sediment buildup reduces effective containment volume

**Risk Assessment:**
Secondary containment would NOT prevent environmental release in the event of Tank 7-B failure.

**Regulatory Compliance:** VIOLATION of 40 CFR 264.193(b)

---

#### Discharge Piping (Outfall System)
**Installation Date:** 1992 (32 years old)
**Material:** Carbon steel (unlined)

**Findings:**
- Ultrasonic thickness testing shows pipe wall loss of 25-45%
- Active pinhole leaks detected at joints #4, #7, and #12
- Soil staining observed beneath buried pipe sections (indicates chronic leakage)

**Risk Assessment:**
Current discharge pipe is actively leaking treated and untreated wastewater into subsurface soil. Groundwater contamination likely already occurring.

### Section 2: Employee Safety Concerns

During confidential interviews, multiple employees reported the following:
- Strong chemical odors near Tank 7-B (indicating vapor leaks)
- Visible liquid seepage at tank base ("like it's sweating")
- Warnings to management ignored or dismissed
- Pressure to continue operations despite visible deterioration

**Quote from anonymous employee:**
*"I've been telling my supervisor for two years that tank is going to fail. He says corporate won't approve the budget. Last month, I put in a work order to at least pump it down to 50% capacity while we wait for repairs. The work order was rejected. They said pumping costs too much."*

### Section 3: Management Response History

**Timeline of Warnings Ignored:**

| Date | Action | Management Response |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **June 2022** | Maintenance report flags corrosion | "Monitor quarterly" |
| **November 2022** | First leak detected, patched | "Patch held, no further action" |
| **March 2023** | EHS recommends tank replacement | "Too expensive, defer to 2025 budget" |
| **August 2023** | Second leak detected | "Emergency patch applied" |
| **December 2023** | Third leak detected | "Patch applied, issue closed" |
| **February 2024** | Employee safety complaint filed | **[REDACTED - HR INVESTIGATION]** |
| **April 2024** | THIS AUDIT CONDUCTED | **[PENDING - SEE SECTION 4]** |

**Pattern Identified:**
Management has consistently prioritized short-term cost avoidance over long-term risk mitigation.

---

### Section 4: Recommended Actions

#### URGENT (Within 30 Days)
1. **Reduce Tank 7-B volume to 25% capacity** to minimize failure risk
   **Cost:** $15,000 (pumping and disposal)

2. **Install continuous leak detection system** around tank perimeter
   **Cost:** $8,000

3. **Conduct structural engineering assessment** by third-party PE
   **Cost:** $12,000

#### HIGH PRIORITY (Within 90 Days)
4. **Replace Tank 7-B** with double-walled HDPE or fiberglass tank
   **Cost:** $850,000 (includes removal, disposal, installation)

5. **Repair secondary containment berm** and restore drainage system
   **Cost:** $45,000

6. **Replace corroded discharge piping** with HDPE Schedule 80
   **Cost:** $120,000

**TOTAL ESTIMATED COST:** $1,050,000

### Section 5: Legal and Regulatory Implications

Failure to act on these findings exposes Riverside Industrial to:
- **RCRA Violations:** Inadequate secondary containment (40 CFR 264.193)
- **Clean Water Act Violations:** Unpermitted discharge via leaking pipes (40 CFR 122.21)
- **OSHA Citations:** General Duty Clause (employee exposure to chemical vapors)
- **Negligence Liability:** In the event of catastrophic failure

Estimated fines if violations discovered during EPA inspection: **$500,000 - $2,000,000**
Estimated remediation costs if spill occurs: **$5,000,000 - $15,000,000**

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

Patricia Nguyen no longer works for Riverside Industrial. She resigned in June 2024, two months after submitting this report. Her exit interview cited "irreconcilable differences regarding safety culture."

You found this report in a dumpster behind the corporate office, mixed in with shredded personnel files. Someone tried to destroy it. They failed.

Tank 7-B is still operating at full capacity.

The patches are still holding.

For now.
