# Data Log 02: Laboratory Analysis Report - Mercury Contamination

## TL;DR
Independent lab testing reveals mercury levels in wetland sediment 340% above EPA safety limits. Methylmercury bioaccumulation detected in tadpoles. Report marked "inconclusive" by company officials despite clear data showing neurotoxic risk.

### Sample Description
Sediment core samples collected from wetland adjacent to Riverside Coal Plant (GPS: 41.2345°N, 87.6543°W). Sample depth: 0-30cm. Visible discoloration noted at 10-15cm layer.

### Test Parameters & Results

| Parameter | Detected Level | EPA Safe Limit | Status |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Total Mercury (Hg)** | **0.68 mg/kg** | **0.2 mg/kg** | **EXCEEDS** |
| Methylmercury (MeHg) | 0.41 mg/kg | 0.1 mg/kg | **EXCEEDS** |
| Lead (Pb) | 45 mg/kg | 400 mg/kg | Within Limits |
| Cadmium (Cd) | 2.1 mg/kg | 10 mg/kg | Within Limits |
| Arsenic (As) | 8.3 mg/kg | 40 mg/kg | Within Limits |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Total mercury concentration is **340% of federal safety threshold**. Methylmercury fraction represents 60% of total mercury, indicating active microbial conversion in anaerobic sediment layers.

### Bioaccumulation Analysis
Supplementary tissue samples (amphibian tadpoles, Lithobates spp.) collected from same site:

- **Tadpole Tissue Mercury:** 1.2 mg/kg (wet weight)
- **Bioaccumulation Factor (BAF):** 1.76x (sediment to tissue)
- **Trophic Magnification Potential:** HIGH

**Interpretation:** Mercury is actively bioaccumulating in lower trophic levels [3]. Adult amphibians feeding on contaminated insects are projected to reach tissue concentrations of 3-5 mg/kg—well above thresholds associated with reproductive failure and neurological impairment [4].

### Source Attribution
Isotopic analysis (δ202Hg) indicates mercury signature consistent with coal combustion emissions [1]. Airborne deposition from nearby power plant is the likely primary source. Mercury flux estimated at 15-20 μg/m²/year [2].

---

### Health Risk Assessment
**Ecological Risk Level:** SEVERE
**Human Exposure Risk:** MODERATE (if fish consumption occurs)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediate sampling of fish tissue to assess human consumption risk
2. Post signage warning against wildlife harvesting
3. Investigate source emissions and atmospheric deposition pathways
4. Consider sediment remediation or wetland closure if concentrations continue to rise

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

This report was buried in a locked drawer marked "Archived - Q2 2024." Someone tried to shred it—you can see the partial tear marks along the edge—but it jammed the machine. The word "INCONCLUSIVE" was added later, in a different pen.

Dr. Okonkwo's signature is authentic. You recognize her name from a news article about a scientist who was fired for "unreliable methodology."

The data doesn't lie. Your pond has been poisoned.

The question is: who knew, and when did they know it?
