## Full Document

**TO:** Regional Operations Directors
**FROM:** Marcus Chen, VP of Cost Optimization
**DATE:** March 15, 2024
**RE:** Q2 Cost Reduction Initiative - Waste Management Protocol Revision
**CLASSIFICATION:** Internal Use Only

Colleagues,

As we approach the end of Q1, I'm pleased to report that our fertilizer production output has increased 18% year-over-year. However, our waste treatment expenses have risen disproportionately, now consuming 14% of operational budgets across our Midwest facilities.

After consultation with Legal and our external environmental consultants, we've identified an opportunity to significantly reduce these costs through strategic realignment of our waste discharge protocols.

**Current Situation:**
Our River Valley facility currently routes agricultural runoff through a three-stage treatment system before discharge. This process costs approximately $47,000 per week in chemicals, energy, and maintenance. Annual expenses exceed $2.4M for this single site.

**Proposed Solution:**
Transition to "natural remediation" by routing untreated runoff directly into adjacent wetland buffer zones. These ecosystems are classified as non-navigable waters under the 2020 Clean Water Rule revision, placing them outside direct EPA jurisdiction. Our legal team confirms this approach carries minimal regulatory risk.

**Financial Impact:**
- **Immediate Savings:** $2.3M annually (River Valley site alone)
- **Avoided Capital Expenses:** $8.5M (deferred treatment plant upgrade)
- **ROI Timeline:** Immediate

**Risk Assessment:**
Environmental Services has flagged potential concerns regarding nitrogen runoff concentrations. However, our consultants note that wetlands are "designed by nature" to filter contaminants. Any localized ecosystem effects will be offset by natural resilience and seasonal water table fluctuations.

Public Affairs advises that this wetland is not a designated critical habitat and sees minimal recreational use. Media exposure risk is rated "low."

**Implementation:**
Effective April 1, facilities will gradually phase out tertiary treatment processes. Discharge pipes will be rerouted to wetland outflows during overnight hours to minimize visibility. Operations will document this as "stormwater runoff" in compliance logs.

I recognize this represents a significant operational shift. However, in today's competitive market, we must be willing to make difficult decisions to maintain shareholder value. Our competitors are already operating under similar protocols.

Questions or concerns should be directed to Legal (ext. 4421) rather than discussed via email.

Best regards,
Marcus Chen
Vice President, Cost Optimization

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

You found this memo tucked inside a corroded filing cabinet near the old processing plant. The signature is still visible, though water damage has made parts of the document illegible. The date is from eight months ago—right when the algae blooms started choking the lily pads.

Your tadpole sibling disappeared shortly after April. You never knew why.

Now you do.
