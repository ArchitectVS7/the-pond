**INSPECTION REPORT**
**Facility Inspection No.: 2024-R5-WTR-1094**
**Inspection Date:** July 22-23, 2024
**Report Issued:** August 15, 2024
**Lead Inspector:** Janet Kowalski, PE (Environmental Engineer)

### Facility Information

**Facility Name:** [REDACTED - FOIA Exemption 4: Confidential Business Information]
**Physical Address:** [REDACTED], River County, Illinois
**NPDES Permit No.:** IL-[REDACTED]
**Facility Type:** Industrial Wastewater Treatment / Chemical Manufacturing
**Receiving Water Body:** [REDACTED] Wetland Complex (Class II Waters)

### Inspection Summary

On July 22-23, 2024, EPA Region 5 conducted a compliance evaluation inspection (CEI) of the above-referenced facility in response to citizen complaints regarding alleged unpermitted discharges to nearby wetlands.

**Inspection Scope:**
- Visual observation of discharge points
- Review of Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) for January-June 2024
- Sampling of effluent and receiving water
- Interview with facility environmental compliance officer

---

### Findings

#### **FINDING 1: Unpermitted Discharge Point**
**Severity: MAJOR VIOLATION**

Inspectors identified an undocumented discharge pipe (designated as "Outfall 004" for this report) located on the eastern boundary of the facility. This pipe was not listed in the current NPDES permit.

Flow rate estimated at [REDACTED] gallons per day. Discharge observed entering [REDACTED] wetland approximately 200 meters downstream.

**Facility Response:**
Environmental Compliance Officer M. Patel stated that Outfall 004 was a "stormwater overflow" and not subject to permit requirements. However, inspectors noted continuous flow during dry weather conditions, inconsistent with stormwater designation.

**Regulatory Citation:** 40 CFR 122.21 - Unpermitted point source discharge
**Recommended Action:** [REDACTED]

---

#### **FINDING 2: Effluent Limit Exceedances**
**Severity: MAJOR VIOLATION**

Laboratory analysis of samples collected from Outfall 004 revealed the following parameter exceedances:

| Parameter | Detected | Permit Limit | Exceedance |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Total Chromium | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED]% |
| Lead | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED]% |
| pH | [REDACTED] | 6.0-9.0 | Outside Range |
| Total Toxic Organics | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED] mg/L | [REDACTED]% |

**Note:** Specific concentration values redacted pursuant to FOIA Exemption 4 (confidential business information).

**Regulatory Citation:** 40 CFR 122.41(a) - Duty to comply with permit limitations
**Recommended Action:** [REDACTED]

---

#### **FINDING 3: Falsified Discharge Monitoring Reports**
**Severity: MAJOR VIOLATION**

Review of DMRs for January-June 2024 showed no reported discharges from Outfall 004. Facility records indicated that monitoring data for this outfall was either not collected or not reported.

Comparison of reported chemical usage (treatment chemicals) versus observed effluent quality suggests systemic under-reporting of actual discharge volumes.

**Facility Response:**
[REDACTED - Exemption 7(A): Ongoing enforcement investigation]

**Regulatory Citation:** 40 CFR 122.41(j)(5) - Duty to report
**Recommended Action:** [REDACTED - Exemption 7(A)]

---

#### **FINDING 4: Receiving Water Impacts**
**Severity: SIGNIFICANT**

Sampling of [REDACTED] wetland sediment and surface water revealed:
- Elevated heavy metal concentrations in sediment (see attached Table 3)
- [REDACTED - Exemption 5: Pre-decisional agency memo]
- Presence of biomarkers indicating chronic toxic stress in aquatic organisms

**Ecological Risk Assessment:**

### Enforcement Recommendations

**Original Recommendation (July 25, 2024):**
[REDACTED - Exemption 7(A): Would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings]

**Revised Recommendation (August 10, 2024):**
EPA recommends that [REDACTED] enter into a voluntary compliance agreement to:
1. Conduct comprehensive site assessment within 180 days
2. Submit corrective action plan within 270 days
3. Implement remediation measures on a timeline to be negotiated with Region 5

**Civil Penalty Assessment:**

## Narrative Context (Player Discovery)

You requested this document under the Freedom of Information Act. It took three months and two appeal letters to get it.

What you received was mostly black bars.

The parts they left visible tell you everything you need to know:
- **Major violations** detected
- **Falsified reports** submitted
- **Receiving water impacts** confirmed

The parts they hid tell you even more:
- Who is responsible
- How bad the contamination really is
- What they're planning to do about it (spoiler: voluntary compliance, not jail time)

Somewhere in a government office, there's an un-redacted version of this report. Someone made the decision to protect the polluter's identity instead of the public's right to know.

You pin this document to your conspiracy board, right next to the corporate memo.

The pattern is becoming clear.
