## Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Educational Video Game on Wetland Pollution

---

**Body:**

Dear [Organization Name] Team,

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I'm developing **Pond Conspiracy**, an investigative roguelike video game that uses environmental storytelling to raise awareness about wetland pollution and corporate environmental negligence.

**About the Game:**
Pond Conspiracy follows a frog protagonist uncovering a conspiracy involving illegal industrial dumping into wetlands. Players discover and analyze authentic data logs—modeled on real EPA reports, lab results, and whistleblower testimonies—to piece together the environmental crime.

The game's narrative is grounded in peer-reviewed research on:
- Mercury bioaccumulation in amphibians
- Agricultural runoff and eutrophication
- Corporate greenwashing tactics
- Regulatory capture and enforcement gaps

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**
I'm seeking feedback from environmental experts to ensure the game's educational content is scientifically accurate and impactful. Specifically, I'd appreciate:

1. **Scientific Review:** Verification that the pollution scenarios depicted are realistic
2. **Resource Recommendations:** Suggestions for player call-to-action (donate, volunteer, learn more)
3. **Partnership Opportunities:** Potential collaboration on in-game educational content or post-release outreach

**What's In It For [Organization Name]:**
- In-game recognition as a scientific consultant
- Bibliography credits linking to your organization's resources
- Potential cross-promotion to our player community
- Optional in-game "Learn More" buttons directing players to your campaigns

**Timeline:**
The game is currently in alpha development (targeting Q2 2025 release). I'm seeking NGO feedback during the beta phase (Q1 2025) to incorporate expert suggestions before launch.

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds like a good fit for [Organization Name]'s educational mission, I'd love to schedule a 20-minute call to discuss further. I can provide a playable demo and detailed research bibliography.

Thank you for the incredible work you do protecting wetlands and wildlife. I hope Pond Conspiracy can amplify your message to a new audience of gamers who care about environmental justice.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL]
[YOUR WEBSITE/PORTFOLIO]

**Attachments:**
- Game pitch deck (PDF)
- Research bibliography (showing peer-reviewed sources)
- Screenshot samples

## Legal Considerations

### What You CAN Do
- Credit NGOs in your game
- Link to their websites
- Quote publicly available research
- Use logos with permission

### What You CANNOT Do
- Imply official endorsement without written agreement
- Use copyrighted materials without permission
- Make financial promises you can't keep
- Misrepresent NGO positions

---

## Success Metrics

Track partnership outcomes:
- **Engagement Rate:** % of NGOs that respond
- **Partnership Rate:** % that agree to collaborate
- **Feedback Quality:** Actionable suggestions received
- **Promotional Impact:** Media coverage or social shares
- **Player Impact:** Traffic to NGO websites from game

---

## Contingency: If No NGOs Respond

**Plan B:**
1. **Academic Consultants:** Reach out to university environmental science departments
2. **Independent Experts:** LinkedIn search for wetland ecologists, environmental chemists
3. **Citizen Science Groups:** Local watershed associations, volunteer monitoring programs
4. **Transparency:** In credits, state "Research based on peer-reviewed literature (see bibliography)"

**You Don't Need NGO Partnership to Launch:**
The bibliography and peer-reviewed sources are sufficient credibility. NGO partnerships are a bonus, not a requirement.

---

## Notes for Developers

**Status:** This outreach requires **human decision-making** and **relationship building**. It cannot be automated.

**Timeline:** Begin outreach during beta phase, not during early development. Wait until you have something concrete to show.

**Tone:** Be humble, collaborative, and clear about mutual benefits. NGOs are mission-driven, not profit-driven—emphasize educational impact.

**Documentation:** Keep records of all communications in case you need to verify permissions or partnerships later.

---

**BLOCKED STORIES:**
- **DATA-005:** Outreach execution (manual, not automatable)
- **DATA-006:** NGO review integration (depends on DATA-005 responses)

**NEXT STEPS (Human Required):**
1. Customize email template for each NGO
2. Prepare demo build + pitch materials
3. Send outreach emails during beta phase
4. Incorporate feedback into final data logs
5. Formalize partnerships before launch
