# Wetland Pollution Research Notes - DATA-001

## Overview
Research compilation on wetland pollution sources for environmental conspiracy narrative. This document serves as the factual foundation for the 7 data logs in Pond Conspiracy.

## Pollution Type 1: Agricultural Runoff

### Sources
- **Nitrogen and Phosphorus**: Fertilizers from farms drain into wetlands, causing eutrophication (algal blooms that deplete oxygen)
- **Pesticides**: Herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides wash into water systems during rain events
- **Animal Waste**: Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) leak manure containing pathogens, antibiotics, and hormones

### Game-Relevant Framing
Corporate agriculture prioritizes yield over ecological impact. Factory farms expand near wetlands to use waterways as free waste disposal. Cost of treating runoff exceeds profit margins, so contamination is "externalized" to taxpayers and ecosystems.

### Environmental Impact
- Algal blooms block sunlight, killing aquatic plants
- Oxygen depletion causes fish kills
- Amphibians (like frogs) absorb pesticides through permeable skin, leading to deformities and population collapse

## Pollution Type 2: Industrial Waste Discharge

### Sources
- **Heavy Metals**: Lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium from manufacturing plants
- **Chemical Solvents**: TCE (trichloroethylene), benzene, and PCBs from factories
- **Thermal Pollution**: Heated water discharged from power plants

### Game-Relevant Framing
Corporations exploit regulatory loopholes to discharge waste at night or during storms when monitoring is lax. Fines for violations are cheaper than proper treatment infrastructure. Whistleblowers face NDAs and legal threats.

### Environmental Impact
- Mercury bioaccumulates in the food chain, reaching toxic levels in predators
- Solvents cause liver damage, reproductive failure, and cancer in wildlife
- Thermal pollution reduces dissolved oxygen, creating "dead zones"

## Pollution Type 3: Urban Runoff

### Sources
- **Motor Oil and Gasoline**: Leaks from vehicles wash into storm drains
- **Road Salt**: Sodium and chloride runoff from winter de-icing
- **Microplastics**: Tire wear particles, synthetic fibers from laundry

### Game-Relevant Framing
Cities prioritize development over wetland preservation. Storm drains route untreated runoff directly into wetlands. Infrastructure upgrades are delayed for decades to avoid tax increases.

### Environmental Impact
- Oil forms surface slicks that suffocate aquatic insects (primary food for tadpoles)
- Road salt increases salinity, harming freshwater species
- Microplastics enter the food web, causing digestive blockages and hormone disruption

## Pollution Type 4: Oil Spills

### Sources
- **Pipeline Leaks**: Aging infrastructure cracks near wetlands
- **Drilling Operations**: Offshore drilling accidents and fracking wastewater spills
- **Transportation**: Train derailments and tanker truck crashes

### Game-Relevant Framing
Oil companies self-report spills, leading to underreporting. Cleanup costs are minimized by declaring wetlands "non-essential" ecosystems. Spill response is delayed to avoid media attention.

### Environmental Impact
- Oil coats vegetation, preventing photosynthesis
- Toxic PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) cause mutations in amphibians
- Habitat destruction forces species migration or local extinction

---

## Pollution Type 5: Mercury Contamination

### Sources
- **Coal Power Plants**: Airborne mercury settles into wetlands
- **Mining Operations**: Abandoned mines leak mercury-laden sediment
- **Industrial Processes**: Chlor-alkali plants, cement production

### Game-Relevant Framing
Power companies lobby against emission standards by claiming economic hardship. Mercury testing is outsourced to labs with financial ties to polluters. Data showing contamination is classified as "proprietary business information."

### Environmental Impact
- Mercury converts to methylmercury in wetland sediments
- Methylmercury is neurotoxic, causing tremors, paralysis, and death in amphibians
- Bioaccumulation: tadpoles → insects → frogs → predators (eagles, otters)

## Additional Sources for Conspiracy Narrative

### Regulatory Capture
- **Revolving Door**: Former EPA officials join corporate boards as "environmental consultants"
- **Defunding**: Inspection budgets cut, reducing site visits from weekly to annual
- **Self-Regulation**: Industries allowed to monitor and report their own compliance

### Cover-Up Tactics
- **Strategic Litigation**: SLAPP lawsuits to silence environmental groups
- **Data Suppression**: Studies showing harm are buried or discredited
- **Greenwashing**: PR campaigns emphasizing minor eco-friendly initiatives while major pollution continues

### Real-World Parallels
- **Flint Water Crisis**: Government downplayed lead contamination
- **PG&E Chromium-6**: Erin Brockovich case (hexavalent chromium in groundwater)
- **DuPont PFOA Scandal**: "Forever chemicals" in drinking water (The Devil We Know documentary)

## Frog-Specific Vulnerabilities

### Why Frogs Are Indicator Species
1. **Permeable Skin**: Absorbs toxins directly from water and air
2. **Dual Life Cycle**: Exposed to pollution as aquatic tadpoles AND terrestrial adults
3. **Site Fidelity**: Return to natal ponds to breed, ensuring multi-generational exposure
4. **Sensitive Development**: Metamorphosis is disrupted by endocrine disruptors

### Documented Effects
- **Atrazine (herbicide)**: Causes male frogs to develop ovaries (Berkeley researcher Tyrone Hayes)
- **Endosulfan (insecticide)**: Skeletal deformities, extra limbs
- **Mercury**: Reduced hopping distance, making frogs easy prey

## Conspiracy Board Connections

### How This Research Informs the 7 Data Logs
1. **Corporate Memo**: Agricultural runoff framed as "unavoidable cost of business"
2. **Lab Report**: Mercury levels exceed EPA limits by 300%
3. **Whistleblower**: Former plant manager exposes illegal night-time dumping
4. **Inspection**: Government report redacted to hide corporate names
5. **Safety Report**: Internal warnings ignored, employees threatened with termination
6. **PR Strategy**: Greenwashing campaign to counter negative press
7. **Financial**: Cost-benefit analysis showing fines cheaper than compliance
