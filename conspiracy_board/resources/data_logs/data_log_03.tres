summary = "Former supervisor testifies under oath about years of illegal night-time toxic waste dumping into wetlands. Management falsified logs, intimidated employees. Whistleblower fired for reporting violations."
full_text = "**SWORN AFFIDAVIT**\n**Case No. 2024-ENV-01847**\n**State Environmental Protection Agency v. Riverside Industrial Corp.**\n\n**Affiant:** James T. Rodriguez\n**Former Position:** Night Shift Supervisor, Wastewater Operations\n**Employment Period:** May 2019 - September 2024\n**Date of Testimony:** October 8, 2024\n\nMy name is James Rodriguez. I worked for Riverside Industrial for five years before being terminated in September 2024. I am providing this testimony voluntarily in hopes that the truth about illegal dumping practices will finally be exposed.\n\n**Actual Practice (Undocumented):**\nIn June 2021, my supervisor, Dale Hutchins, told me that corporate had implemented a \"cost optimization strategy.\" Starting the following Monday, we were instructed to bypass the treatment system entirely during night shifts (10 PM - 6 AM).\n\nThe new protocol was simple: open valve #7 on the eastern discharge line, which routed untreated sludge directly into the drainage culvert leading to the wetland preserve. We were told to log this discharge as \"stormwater runoff\" in our compliance records.\n\n**What We Were Dumping:**\n- Heavy metals (chromium, lead, cadmium) from metal plating operations\n- Organic solvents (trichloroethylene, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone)\n- Acidic rinse water (pH 2-3) from pickling baths\n- Process cooling water laced with anti-corrosion chemicals\n\nI personally witnessed this discharge turn the culvert water a milky gray color. By morning, the discoloration would dissipate downstream into the wetland, leaving no visible trace.\n\n**Volume and Frequency:**\nWe dumped approximately 15,000 gallons per night, five nights per week. Over three years, I estimate we illegally discharged more than 10 million gallons of untreated industrial waste into protected wetlands.\n\n**Intimidation and Retaliation:**\nIn March 2023, one of my crew members, Luis Herrera, refused to participate. He said his family fished in the river downstream and he wasn't going to \"poison his own kids.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Luis was fired for \"repeated safety violations.\" His personnel file was retroactively filled with write-ups dated months earlier.\n\nAfter Luis was gone, Dale called a meeting. He told us that anyone who \"couldn't handle the heat\" was welcome to leave, but that Riverside had \"very good lawyers\" and that whistleblowers often found themselves \"unhireable in this industry.\"\n\n**The Breaking Point:**\nIn August 2024, I noticed dead fish floating in the culvert. A lot of them. I also saw deformed frogs—missing legs, extra limbs, cloudy eyes.\n\nI took photos on my phone and sent them to the Illinois EPA hotline. Two days later, I was called into HR and accused of \"stealing company property.\" I was fired on the spot, escorted out by security, and told that if I spoke to the media, I'd be sued for violating my NDA.\n\nI'm done being silent.\n\n[Signed and notarized]\nJames T. Rodriguez\nOctober 8, 2024"
