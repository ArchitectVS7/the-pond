# BulletUpHell Plugin

Fork from: https://github.com/Dark-Peace/BulletUpHell

## Installation (Day 1 Task - BULLET-001)

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone to this directory
3. Integrate with project

This is a risk mitigation per PRD CI-3.3:
"Fork repository on Day 1, maintain internal copy. If upstream development stops, we own the code."
