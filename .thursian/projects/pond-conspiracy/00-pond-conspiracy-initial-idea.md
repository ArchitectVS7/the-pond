In Pond Conspiracy, you play as a lone warrior frog navigating a once-peaceful wetland now spiraling into ecological chaos. From a top-down perspective, waves of hostile, hyper-aggressive frogs swarm you as the pond becomes increasingly unstable, mutating with every passing minute. Your mission isn’t simply survival—it's to uncover the hidden chemical sources corrupting the ecosystem and weaponize them before your enemies do.

As you battle your way through escalating hordes, you collect microplastics, runoff toxins, and bizarre alchemical components drifting through the water. These materials become your upgrade currency, letting you enhance your frog with outlandish mutations—elastic tongues that lash like whips, toxin-infused splash attacks, ricochet bubble shots, bioelectric pulses, and mobility boosts like lily-pad dashes. Each run becomes a frantic dance of evasion, experimentation, and ecological absurdity as the pond warps into an increasingly hostile arena.

At the heart of the campaign lies a tongue-in-cheek conspiracy: someone (or something) is pumping chemicals into the environment to alter frog behavior, and you’re determined to turn the tables—using the very pollutants fueling the chaos as the key to victory. With roguelike progression, escalating enemy waves, and a deeply satirical edge, Pond Conspiracy blends chaotic shooter action with environmental parody, challenging players to survive, adapt, and ultimately master the strange science simmering beneath the lily pads.
