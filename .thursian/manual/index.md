# Thursian Engineering Manual  
**Revision** [Dec-13-2025] 

*A Field Guide for Human Engineers Working Among Synthetic Minds*  

Welcome to the Thursian Automation Division.  
You are now entering a workspace shared between human intelligence and a latticework of computational minds—planners, analysts, developers, reviewers, and decision agents—coordinated through Claude-Flow.

This manual accompanies you through your first cycle inside the Virtual Engineering Office.  
It teaches you how to install the Thursian System, how to operate multi-agent swarms, how to maintain stability among synthetic personalities, and how to extend the office with new minds.
