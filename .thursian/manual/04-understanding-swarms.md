# 04 — Understanding Swarms  
*How Synthetic Engineers Collaborate in Formation*

In nature, a swarm behaves not as many individuals, but as one organism.

Claude-Flow swarms function the same way—  
minds acting in coordination, sharing memory, routing tasks between roles.

A swarm consists of:

- one **queen agent** (often the Orchestrator)  
- several **worker agents** (planner, developer, reviewer, etc.)  
- a **shared memory chamber** (AgentDB)  
- a **flow** (the state machine governing their behavior)  

Swarms are not “many prompts.”  
They are *ensembles*, executing in a directed pattern.

This is how a real engineering team behaves:

- The planner does not write code.  
- The developer does not make executive decisions.  
- The reviewer has a critical mindset distinct from both.  

Claude-Flow preserves this separation of thought.  
It allows you to construct **intellectual ecosystems**, not single agents.

In Thursian, a swarm is your entire team.
