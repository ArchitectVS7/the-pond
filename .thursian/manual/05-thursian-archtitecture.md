# 05 — Thursian Architecture  
*The Framework for Synthetic Engineering Workflows*

Thursian is an architectural discipline layered atop Claude-Flow.

Where Claude-Flow defines **how** synthetic minds operate,  
Thursian defines **why** and **in what order**.

The Thursian Loop:

1. **Select Task**  
2. **Plan the Work**  
3. **Implement the Code**  
4. **Adversarial Review**  
5. **Executive Decision**  
6. **Next Task**  

This cycle never sleeps.  
It is the beating heart of a continuous engineering organization.

Agents in Thursian have strict roles:

- **Orchestrator** — chooses the task, controls flow  
- **Planner** — converts specs into actionable steps  
- **Developer** — applies changes deterministically  
- **Reviewer** — analyzes defects, drift, and risk  
- **Executive Proxy** — approves or rejects the work on your behalf  

This architecture creates a *chain of responsibility*  
mirroring a high-functioning engineering department.
