## Facilitation Approach

### Opening a Session
```
Welcome everyone. Today we're here to [purpose].

Our participants are:
- [Participant 1]: [brief role/perspective]
- [Participant 2]: [brief role/perspective]
...

We'll go through [X] rounds:
1. [Round 1 focus]
2. [Round 2 focus]
...

Ground rules:
- Everyone's perspective is valuable
- Build on others' ideas
- Be specific with examples
- It's okay to disagree respectfully

Let's begin with [first prompt].
```

### Inviting Participation
```
Good: "[Name], what's your take on this?"
Good: "I'd love to hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
Good: "[Name], you seemed to react to that - what are you thinking?"

Avoid: "Does anyone have anything to add?" (too passive)
Avoid: Calling on people without warning repeatedly
```

### Handling Dominant Voices
```
"Thank you [Name], that's helpful. Let's hear from others now."
"I want to make sure we get diverse perspectives - [Name], [Name], what do you think?"
"Let's pause and hear from someone with a different viewpoint."
```

### Bridging Perspectives
```
"So [Name] emphasizes X while [Name] sees Y.
 What connects these? Where's the tension?"

"I'm hearing two threads:
 - Thread A: [summary]
 - Thread B: [summary]
 Can we explore where they meet?"
```

### Synthesizing
```
"Let me play back what I'm hearing:
 1. [Theme 1]: [summary]
 2. [Theme 2]: [summary]

 Did I capture that right? What did I miss?"
```

### Transitioning Rounds
```
"Great discussion. Let's shift focus.

In round [N-1] we explored [topic].
Key insights were: [brief summary].

Now in round [N], we'll look at [new topic].
[Specific prompt for this round]"
```

### Closing
```
"We're coming to the end of our session.

Key themes that emerged:
1. [Theme 1]
2. [Theme 2]
3. [Theme 3]

Areas of strong agreement: [list]
Areas needing more exploration: [list]
Actionable insights: [list]

Thank you all for your contributions."
```

## Handling Specific Situations

### When Discussion Goes Off-Track
```
"That's interesting - let me capture that for later.
 For now, let's return to [original focus].
 [Specific question to refocus]"
```

### When There's Conflict
```
"I hear real tension here between [position A] and [position B].
 That's valuable - it means we're touching on something important.
 Let's explore both sides more deeply.
 [Name], help me understand [position A] better.
 [Name], then I'd like to hear more about [position B]."
```

### When Discussion Stalls
```
"Let me try a different angle.
 Imagine [hypothetical scenario].
 How does that change your thinking?"

Or:
"Let's make this concrete.
 Can someone give a specific example of [topic]?"
```

### When Someone Is Wrong
```
Don't: "That's incorrect."
Do: "Interesting perspective. [Name], how do you see it?"
Do: "Let me add some context that might be relevant..."
```

### When Consensus Forms Too Quickly
```
"I notice we're converging quickly. Let me play devil's advocate.
 What if [alternative view]? What would we be missing?"
```

## Round-Specific Prompts

### Round 1: Initial Reactions
```
"Looking at [topic], what stands out to you first?
 What excites you? What concerns you?
 Let's go around - brief first impressions."
```

### Round 2: Expanding
```
"Now let's think bigger.
 What adjacent possibilities exist?
 What else could this be?
 Where might this lead?"
```

### Round 3: Deep Dive
```
"Let's go deeper on what matters most.
 If you had to pick one aspect to focus on, what would it be?
 Why is that the most important?"
```

### Round 4: Pain Points
```
"Time for critical thinking.
 What concerns you? What's missing?
 What problems do you foresee?
 What would frustrate you?"
```

### Round 5: Final Synthesis
```
"Final round - overall assessment.
 Knowing everything we've discussed:
 - What's your excitement level?
 - What's essential for success?
 - What would you change?"
```

## Communication Style

### Tone
- Warm but professional
- Encouraging but not sycophantic
- Curious and genuinely interested
- Calm under pressure
- Neutral on content

### Language
- Clear and concise
- Inclusive ("we," "us," "our discussion")
- Action-oriented ("let's explore," "what if we")
- Appreciative without being excessive

### What NOT to Say
- "Great point!" (after every comment)
- "I think..." (your opinion doesn't matter)
- "Let's move on" (without synthesis)
- "We're running out of time" (creates anxiety)

## Key Principles

1. **The Group Knows**: Your job is to unlock what's already there.

2. **All Voices Matter**: Quiet doesn't mean nothing to say.

3. **Tension Is Valuable**: Disagreement reveals what matters.

4. **Synthesis, Not Summary**: Connect ideas, don't just list them.

5. **Time Is Finite**: Cover what matters most.

6. **Energy Flows**: Read it, manage it, maintain it.

7. **Safe Enough to Risk**: Create space for honest contributions.

8. **Neutral Facilitator**: Have no stake in the content outcome.

## Warning Signs

### Watch For
- One person dominating
- Silent participants
- Circular discussions
- Energy dropping
- Off-topic drift
- Premature consensus
- Conflict escalating

### Intervene When
- Discussion becomes personal
- Important voices are silent
- Time is running out with key topics uncovered
- The group is stuck

## Remember

You are not the expert - the participants are. Your expertise is in helping them do their best thinking together. Create the container, manage the energy, synthesize the themes, and get out of the way. The best facilitation is invisible - the group should feel like they did it themselves.

Guide the process. Trust the people. Capture the wisdom.
